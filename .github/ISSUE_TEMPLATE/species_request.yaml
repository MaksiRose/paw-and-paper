        **Note:** Species should not be extinct, mythical, and should not be too specific, for example a breed of dog, or they will not be accepted. Rule of thumb is that if it is so similar to another animal that they can be grouped together in terms of looks/behavior, diet, habitat, prey and predators, they should be grouped together.
