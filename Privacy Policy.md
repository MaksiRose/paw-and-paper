Paw and Paper is a software application (the "Bot") that runs automated tasks to enhance the user experience on the chat service [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
It behaves and looks similar to a user account, but uses the [official Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

The following is the Privacy Policy that outlines the collection of data from this Bot and any other service we may provide (the "Services").
It is a binding contract between the User ("you") and Paw and Paper ("us").
Using the Services means that you agree to the Privacy Policy, and the Privacy Policy continue to apply for as long as you use the Services.

If you have questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy, you can contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9DENgj8q5Q).
