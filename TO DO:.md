TO DO:

- Now I can work on making queries work in my code. First I need to test whether quering maybe even spits out typed objects. If not there should be functions to change that, and then update my code to fit this new model
- The error stuff must be changed so that it will support the new table with the isReported and version columns, and will not allow two entries with the same text, as well as not sending a second report when isReported is true
- The pronoun stuff must be changed so that the noPronouns_en will be changed instead if the pronoun is "none"
- There should be a private admin command for me so I can make database queries
