# Introduction

Paw and Paper is a software application (the "Bot") that runs automated tasks to enhance the user experience on the chat service [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
It behaves and looks similar to a user account, but uses the [official Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

The following are the Terms of Service (the "Terms") that govern the use of this Bot and any other service we may provide (the "Services").
It is a binding contract between the User ("you") and Paw and Paper ("us").
Using the Services means that you agree to the Terms, and the Terms continue to apply for as long as you use the Services.
The Terms include the content of this document, as well as the content of the Privacy Policy.

If you have questions or concerns regarding the Terms, you can contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9DENgj8q5Q).

# Modifications

We may update these Terms at any time.

Updates to the Terms may be communicated through new [Releases](https://github.com/MaksiRose/paw-and-paper/releases) on this GitHub repository, as well as through [published](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels-) posts in the "updates" channel (channel ID: 958847056133378068) on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9DENgj8q5Q).

Updates are effective with the update of the Bot to that release or any release newer than it.
The current release version of the Bot can be checked using the `help` command under the section "Bot".
